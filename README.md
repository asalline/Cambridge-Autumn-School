Jupyter Notebooks and needed files for Autumn School in University of Cambridge

To get the Jupyter Notebooks to work, one needs to install several packages for Python. <br>

Preferably first one installs [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/index.html).

After installation there is to create a new conda environment which will contain a neede Python version and all the packages.

The command to create new conda is 'conda create --name yourenv', where "yourenv" is the name of your environment.
